These deal with environmental variation in fitness
* Haldane1948 : does 1D stable cline including dominance for step fitness gradient
* Fisher1950 : continuous gradient in selection
* Hansen1966 : does numerical solns to discretized ODE including observing minimal patch size
* Nagylaki1975 : writes down equations in 2D and conditions for stable solns
* Slatkin1975 and Maruyama : does numerical iteration of the discrete equations for a 1D cline, showing the expected cline is flatted by drift (but see Polechova2011)
* Felsenstein1975, genetic drift in clines : also looks at how genetic drift affects slope and center of clines but with different assumptions than Slatkin1975

These deal with hybrid zones
* Bazykin1969 : writes down the stable solution for the one-dimensional cline
* barton1979dynamics of hybrid zones: looks at how hybrid zones move using a potential; also looks at the strength of stochastic effects. seems to NOT say how fast they relax?
* barton1979gene flow past a cline : step in frequency of linked neutral allele 
     proportional to gradient in frequency and inverse to recomb rate
     adaptive introgression occurs quickly 
* barton1985 and hewitt, analysis of hybrid zones : a REVIEW of everything up 'til 85 (and some not yet published)
* barton1986 and bengtsson, the barrier to genetic exchange : looks at many linked incompatibilities
     with barrier B, neutral allele delayed by (B/sigma)^2, 
     while adaptively introgressing allele delayed only if (B/sigma)^2 > 1/s.
     also does size of step of allele frequency
* barton1986 effects of linkage : gets strength of barrier to linked neutral alleles, produces a "stepped cline"
* barton1989 and hewitt, adaptation, speciation, and hybrid zones : another review, shorter.
* barton1993 and gale, genetic analysis of hybrid zones: compares cline shapes of different mechanisms;
     also writes down PDE for stable pattern of linkage
* barton2000 and shpak, effect of epistasis : more about LD on many linked selected loci
* barton2008effect of a barrier to gene flow : on fluctuations in allele frequency, using diffusion approximation; 
     finds is more sensitive in 2d than 1d

This deals with both:
* Slatkin1973 : does environmental cline and minimal width of a patch;
     shows discontinuous freqs at barriers to dispersal
     AND observes that het disadvantage leads to steeper clines,
     so maybe environment determines location of cline; het disadvantage the shape
* May1975 : spatial resolution of adaptation; also does het disadvantage
* Polechova2011 and Barton, genetic drift widens the expected cline but narrows individual clines; 
     somewhat different answers for environmental step-clines and for tension zones
