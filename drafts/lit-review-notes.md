%% these deal with environmental variation in fitness
% Haldane1948 : does 1D stable cline including dominance for step fitness gradient
% Fisher1950 : continuous gradient in selection
% Hansen1966 : does numerical solns to discretized ODE including observing minimal patch size
% Nagylaki1975 : writes down equations in 2D and conditions for stable solns
%%%
%% these deal with hybrid zones
% Bazykin1969 : writes down the stable solution for the one-dimensional cline
% barton1979dynamics of hybrid zones: looks at how hybrid zones move using a potential; also looks at the strength of stochastic effects. seems to NOT say how fast they relax?
% barton1979gene flow past a cline : step in frequency of linked neutral allele 
%    proportional to gradient in frequency and inverse to recomb rate
%    adaptive introgression occurs quickly 
% barton1985 and hewitt, analysis of hybrid zones : a REVIEW of everything up 'til 85 (and some not yet published)
% barton1986 and bengtsson, the barrier to genetic exchange : looks at many linked incompatibilities
%    with barrier B, neutral allele delayed by (B/sigma)^2, 
%    while adaptively introgressing allele delayed only if (B/sigma)^2 > 1/s.
%    also does size of step of allele frequency
% barton1986 effects of linkage : gets strength of barrier to linked neutral alleles, produces a "stepped cline"
% barton1993 and gale, genetic analysis of hybrid zones: compares cline shapes of different mechanisms;
%    also writes down PDE for stable pattern of linkage
% barton1989 and hewitt, adaptation, speciation, and hybrid zones : another review, shorter.
% barton2000 and shpak, effect of epistasis : more about LD on many linked selected loci
% barton2008effect of a barrier to gene flow : on fluctuations in allele frequency, using diffusion approximation; 
%    finds is more sensitive in 2d than 1d
% polechova2015 and barton, limits to adaptation along environmental gradients : looks at stochasticity but primarily how the edge of a range is determined
%%%
%% this deals with both:
% Slatkin1973 : does environmental cline and minimal width of a patch;
%    shows discontinuous freqs at barriers to dispersal
%    AND observes that het disadvantage leads to steeper clines,
%    so maybe environment determines location of cline; het disadvantage the shape
% May1975 : spatial resolution of adaptation; also does het disadvantage
