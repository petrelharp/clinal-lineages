\section*{Introduction}

% summary of intro:

%  most work so far just looks at clines

%  here we look at that stuff

The process of speciation commonly involves allopatric divergence in relative isolation \citep{Coyne2004}.  
When formerly isolated populations come back into contact 
before reproductive isolation is complete, gene flow is still possible. 
As two such populations interbreed,
individuals' genomes can be labeled according to which ancestral population they are inherited from,
and local interbreeding and migration of such populations
creates a gradient of ancestry assignments across geography,
centered on their point of contact \citep{Barton1985}. 
%\plr{(check that neutral clines discussed in barton '85)}
If the populations are sufficiently diverged,
this process leaves a distinct pattern of variation across the genome, 
in which long tracts of divergent haplotypes from each ancestral population  
are broken up by historical recombination events,
leading to substantial correlations in ancestry between distant markers.


Gene flow will eventually erase 
both geographic clines in ancestry, and strong correlations in ancestry.
Subsets of the genome can maintain stable clines in ancestry if selection against migrant, or hybrid, genotypes impedes gene flow across the hybrid zone \citep{Barton1979a}. The influence of selection on linked loci also prevents the mixing of ancestry at regions surrounding these loci, the effect of which decreases with physical genomic distance \citep{Barton1986,Barton1983}. 
The mixing of ancestries of a given genome is mediated by 
the process of recombination, forming chromosomal \emph{junctions} in ancestry \citep{Fisher1954, Chapman2002, Baird2003}.   
The expected distribution of lengths of unbroken ancestry in admixed populations has been previously described under neutral conditions both in single populations and in contact zones \citep[e.g.][]{Gravel2012,Hellenthal2014,Sedghifar2015}.  

% Variation in \yb{ the action of } selection against migrant alleles within the genome results in genome-wide heterogeneity in cline width, as the frequency of foreign ancestry surrounding targets of selection is reduced \citep{Barton1979}. 
% While these patterns of co-ancestry have been described in multi-locus systems, the \yb{expected length of ancestral tracts around selected loci in admixing populations remains poorly understood}\alisa{, especially in the geographic context of hybrid zones.}
\yb{While empirical patterns of the block length distribution in hybrid zones have rarely been used to inform the history of selection,}  \alisa{the availability of dense genotype data in combination with linkage information pave a way to utilize such patterns to better understand the processes operating in hybrid zones. } %GREAT SENTENCE!!
Here, we investigate expected patterns of co-ancestry \yb{ --- that is, the genomic scale at which ancestry strongly covaries between sites --- } across a hybrid zone in the presence of selection. 


The extensive history of population genetic modeling of hybrid zones has focused largely on the equilibrium states of ancestry clines \citep{Barton1979a,Barton1986}.  
Since stronger selection reduces the amount of genetic mixing,
these models predict the narrowest clines 
(i.e., the most rapid changes in allele frequencies)
at loci close to selected loci, and wider clines at less tightly linked loci.
This provides some expectation for how selection shapes covariation in ancestry at a single locus over \emph{geographic space}.
Our aim here is to extend this to include expectations for how selection shapes covariance in ancestry over \emph{genomic space}.

Covariance in ancestry across a genome provides information about the number of surviving recombination events that have taken place between ancestral genotypes and therefore provides information about the age of the hybrid zone and the relative strength of selection affecting subsets of the genome. Our goal is to understand how selection against hybrids interacts with dispersal and recombination to produce observed patterns ancestry around selected sites in recently established hybrid zones. In addition to interpreting non-equilibrium patterns of diversity in hybrid zones, this could be especially important for understanding the impact of selection on the extent of mixing of ancestral genomes and, consequently, the maintenance of species distinctness. In the extreme case of zero fitness in first-generation hybrids, for example, parental genomes will never mix and the stable hybrid zone will resemble a recently formed one. 
If, on the other hand, hybrids have non-zero fitness, some amount of introgression can occur, and  patterns of introgression can provide information about selection \yb{in addition to the} extent of hybridization, and timing of secondary contact \citep{Price2009, Hellenthal2014}. 
\yb{In this latter case, heterogeneous patterns of ancestry across the genome potentially allows researchers to identify putative targets of selection in hybridizing populations.}  
\yb{To date, researchers have done so by examining heterogeneous clines in ancestry across loci \citep{Porter1997, Gompert2012}, but have not made use of the information contained in the length of ancestry blocks around putatively selected loci.}  

Under a model of selection against hybrids, migrant haplotypes containing the selected locus will be removed rapidly from the population, preventing introgression in surrounding genomic regions. We therefore expect \yb{a deficit of} short blocks of foreign ancestry surrounding the selected locus, with this effect becoming more pronounced further away from the center of a hybrid zone. As a corollary to this, conditional on having the ancestry that is at lower frequency (that is, being on the `wrong' side of the hybrid zone), the length of unbroken ancestry surrounding the selected locus will be relatively long when far away from the zone center.  This is because an unfit haplotype is more likely to be a recent migrant from the other side of the hybrid zone, and therefore will not have experienced many recombination events. 

Using a combination of predictions from theory and simulated hybrid zones, we present a model of genome-wide patterns coancestry as they relate to hybrid zone age, genetic distance from selected locus and geographic distance from hybrid zone center. For this, we build on the neutral framework presented in \citet{Sedghifar2015} to derive the expected distribution of ancestry block lengths across a contact zone.  
\yb{The theoretical expectations developed in this manuscript can aid in the identification of loci under selection in hybridizing populations.}

\subsection*{The Model}

We consider two isolated populations
--- labeled \emph{Species $A$} and \emph{Species $B$} ---  
that came into contact $T$ generations in the past.  
We will say that species $A$ was initially on the ``left'' of the zone of contact, which corresponds to spatial positions $x<0$.  
After contact, the populations live across continuous geographical space,
with random, local dispersal that we take to be Gaussian
(although this should not affect the conclusions if the true dispersal distribution is not too fat-tailed).

We model selection through only a single, underdominant locus:
at this locus, there are two alleles, one corresponding to each of the ancestral populations,
and individuals who are heterozygous at this locus produce on average $1-s$ times as many offspring than either homozygote.
Although most selection in hybrid zones is likely more complex than this simple situation, 
previous work has shown that such models generate clines that are effectively indistinguishable from models of ecological selection or epistatic systems \cite{Kruuk1999,Barton2000a}.

As in \citet{Sedghifar2015}, 
we gain substantial insight by considering where the ancestors of modern-day individuals lived,
i.e., where their lineages fall across geography as we look further back towards the time of first contact.
We say that a locus in a sampled individual is of \emph{ancestry} $A$ if it has been inherited from an individual of species $A$ at the time of secondary contact,
i.e., if its lineage traces back to to the $A$ side.
A block of genome is of ancestry $A$ if every locus in it does the same;
recombination events may cause us to follow more than one lineage back to determine the block's ancestry,
and the block will be of ancestry $A$ if all lineages trace back to the $A$ side.
This process, in which recombination events cause such lineages to \emph{branch},
is depicted in Figure~\ref{Fig:schematic}.
We say that a block of genome is on the $A$ \emph{background} if it is physically linked to an allele of ancestry $A$ at the selected locus;
if the block includes the selected site then it is necessarily on the $A$ background.
As the identity of the selected allele determines how selection acts on the haplotype,
and linked variation can only move between the $A$ and the $B$ background in heterozygotes,
a key factor in these models is the density and fecundity of heterozygotes.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{figs/BM_schematic}
\caption{A cartoon representation of a haplotype under the model. The black line represents the path, backwards in time, of a site under selection ($L_B$) that is sampled in the present day. The center of the hybrid zone is defined at geographic position $x=0$, such that ancestry A segregates at lower frequency for $x>0$. Here, because of negative selection, $L_B$ migrates rapidly back to $x>0$ from a position $x<0$. Red dots represent recombination events along the entire haplotype. When a recombination separates two chunks of the sampled haplotype takes place, a branching event occurs and these splitting lineages are represented by colored lines (here the initial haplotype is broken up into 3 chunks over 100 generations). Subsequent recombination events can switch the selected background to which a chunk is linked.  Here, yellow lineages are linked to $L_A$ , and blue lineages are linked to $L_B$. Based on position 100 generations after contact, from right to left the chunks are of ancestry $(A,B,B)$.}\label{Fig:schematic}
\end{figure}

%As an approximation, we consider a cline of narrow width (look up cline width for underdominance, Barton/May?), such that the frequency of migrant alleles is exponential and negligible at distance away from the center of the hybrid zone. This means that recombination events that occur away from the center of the zone do not result in a change in $a$.


%%%%%%%% %%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Analysis}

In this section we aim to give both heuristics for how lineages move, 
that are helpful in establishing order-of-magnitude estimates,
and analytics, mostly in terms of partial differential equations needing numerical solution.

\paragraph{Establishment of the cline at the selected locus}
The deterministic theory predicts that after secondary contact,
the two alleles at the selected locus will form a stable cline \citep{Barton1979},
affecting neighboring loci as well.
First, we turn our attention to how the cline at the selected locus itself is formed.
Let $p(x,t)$ denote the frequency of the $A$ allele at spatial location $x$ and time $t$.  
Suppose that secondary contact occurred at time $t=0$, 
and that $p(x,0) = 1$ if $x<0$ and $p(x,0)=0$ if $x>0$.
% (In discrete computations, a deme at $x=0$ has $p(0,0)=1/2$.)
Let $\sigma^2$ be the mean squared distance between parent and offspring 
(i.e., the variance of the distribution of dispersal distance).
Assuming that: (i) alleles locally assort into diploids randomly, 
(ii) habitat and dispersal are homogeneous, and 
(iii) $s$ and $\sigma$ are small, then the commonly-used equation that $p$ solves is
\begin{align} \label{eqn:cline_pde}
    \dot p = \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \Delta p + s p (1-p) (2p-1) ,
\end{align}
where $\dot p(t,x)$ is the time derivative and $\Delta p$ is the Laplacian,
as derived in \citet{Bazykin1969}; for discussion of diploidy see \citep{christiansen1995genotypic}.
Although there is no known exact analytic solution to this equation, even in steady state, 
a good approximation to the equilibrium solution is that
$\lim_{t \to \infty} p(x,t) \approx (1+\tanh(-2x\sqrt{s}/\sigma))/2$ \citep{Bazykin1969}. 
This relies on numerous approximations, but the general conclusions should be quite robust: 
the stable cline has width of order $\sigma/\sqrt{s}$, and decays exponentially. 
Note that rescaling space and time by $\sigma/s$ and $1/s$ respectively in equation \eqref{eqn:cline_pde} results in a dimensionless equation,
implying that the cline establishes over a timescale of the order $1/s$. 
In other words, the cline is established through diffusion, which is slowed down somewhat by selection against heterozygotes. 
%\alisa{I don't think I understand the independence from $\sigma$?}
%\plr{It gets set up at speed $\sigma$ over a distance proportional to $\sigma$.}



\paragraph{Lineages at the selected locus}
Now suppose that the frequency profile of the selected allele $p(x,t)$ is known.
We will understand first how lineages of sampled individuals behave at the selected locus,
from which lineages at linked loci require only a minor modification.

Consider the collection of $A$ alleles found at geographic location $x$.
The expected number, among these alleles, that had a parent at location $y$ in the previous generation 
is proportional to the number of $A$ alleles that were at $y$ multiplied by the per-generation probability of dispersing from $y$ to $x$. 
In other words, lineages move as a random walk determined by the dispersal kernel,
but biased towards locations where the selected allele they carry is at higher frequency.
(Lineages are also biased towards regions with higher fecundity,
and thus away from the hybrid zone, but we assume that $s$ is small and ignore this.)

Making the same assumptions as for equation \eqref{eqn:cline_pde}, the derivation in Appendix \ref{apx:lineage_derivation} shows 
how the lineage of an $A$ allele moves as Brownian motion with speed $\sigma$
with drift $\sigma^2 \grad \log p(x,t)$ (i.e., it moves at speed $\sigma^2$ in the potential $-\log p$).
% \alisa{note to self to read through appendix when written}
To see why this is true, note that the probability that the parent of an $A$ allele found at $x$
lived at position $x+r$ is proportional to $\P\{R=r\} p(x+r)$, where $R$ is the random dispersal distance;
and so the mean displacement from offspring to parent is $\E[R p(x+R)]/\E[p(x+R)]$.
% $$ = \E[ R ( p(x) + R p'(x) ) ]/ p(x) + O(R^3) $$
Using that $\E[R]=0$ and $\E[R^2]=\sigma^2$
and expanding $p()$ to first order about $x$ shows that this mean displacement is approximately $\sigma^2 p'(x)/p(x)$,
\plr{Does that help at all?}

At a geographic position far from the center, $p=1$ to the left, and is proportional to  $\exp(-x\sqrt{s}/\sigma)$ to the right.
Therefore, roughly, lineages on ``their own'' side wander randomly,
while lineages on ``the wrong'' side are pushed at constant speed $\sigma/\sqrt{s}$ 
back towards the side where they are more common. 
Since an $A$ allele must by definition have been inherited from the $A$ side of the barrier 
at the time of secondary contact, this push must get more intense the closer it is to the time of secondary contact.
Lineages of $B$ alleles do the same thing, of course, but in the opposite direction. 
% \alisa{I want to make a figure from the simulations that show the rapid retreat of wrong ancestries back to where they came from}

Note that this description gives more information than the steady-state solution,
since in that analysis only the ratio $\sigma/\sqrt{s}$ appears.
Here we see that lineages with $\sigma=10$ and $s=.16$ move quite differently
to lineages with $\sigma=1$ and $s=.0016$,
reflecting strong differences in selection against heterozygotes,
even though the stable clines have the same form.

\paragraph{Lineages at linked loci}
The behavior of a lineage at a linked locus is similar to a selected locus,
except that when in heterozygotes the lineage may move between backgrounds:
if we follow back through time a lineage at a locus we find linked to an $A$ allele, 
it will first tend to be inherited from ancestors to the left (as $A$ lineages drift to the left),
but if it spends time in the clinal region where recombination may happen,
it may be found to have been inherited from a $B$-carrying individual,
whose ancestors will tend to be more from the right.

Suppose we sample an allele today at a locus at recombination distance $r$ to the selected site.
We will follow its lineage back through time, using $\tau$ to denote ``time ago'' to avoid confusion.
If $X_\tau$ is the geographic location of its ancestor $\tau$ generations ago,
and $Z_\tau$ is the identity of the selected allele that ancestor carried,
then we say that $X$ moves as a diffusion pushed by either $\log(p)$ or $\log(1-p)$ (same as previously described movement of a selected allele),
and that $Z$ jumps between $A$ and $B$ at rate either $r (1-p)$  (from $A$ to $B$)or $r p$ (for $B$ to $A$).

We can describe this process formally in It\^o notation:
with $B_\tau$ a standard Brownian motion,
$T_B$ the first time $Z_\tau = B$, and likewise for $T_A$,
\begin{align}
    \begin{aligned} \label{eqn:lineage_motion}
        dX_\tau &= \begin{cases}
             \sigma^2 \grad \log(p(X_\tau,\tau)) d\tau + \sigma dB_\tau \qquad & \text{if } Z_\tau = A \\
             \sigma^2 \grad \log(1-p(X_\tau,\tau)) d\tau + \sigma dB_\tau \qquad & \text{if } Z_\tau = B 
        \end{cases} \\
        % \P\{ Z_{\tau+\epsilon} = B \given Z_\tau = A \} &= \epsilon r (1-p(X_\tau,\tau)) + O(\epsilon^2) \\
        % \P\{ Z_{\tau+\epsilon} = A \given Z_\tau = B \} &= \epsilon r p(X_\tau,\tau) + O(\epsilon^2)  .
        \P\{ T_B &> u \given Z_\tau = A \} = \exp\left( - r \int_0^u (1-p(X_s,s)) ds \right) \\
        \P\{ T_A &> u \given Z_\tau = B \} = \exp\left( - r \int_0^u p(X_s,s) ds \right) .
    \end{aligned}
\end{align}

\alisa{This process of a haplotype sampled in the present day tracing it's path $X_\tau$ backwards in time, while splitting and changing backgrounds $Z_\tau$ through recombination, is shown in Figure~\ref{Fig:schematic}.}

        for the same figure over a longer period of time.
    }
    \label{fig:linked_cline_heatmaps}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Linked clines}
We can use this diffusion model for lineages to compute expected clines in ancestry,
i.e., the expected proportion of individuals who inherit from species $A$,
as a function of space, time, and position on the genome.
Precisely, we need the probability that 
an allele sampled $t$ generations after secondary contact at location $x$,
at recombination distance $r$ to a selected allele of type $z$,
is inherited from an individual of ancestry $A$,
where $z$ can be either $A$ or $B$.
We denote this probability $q_z(x,t,r)$.
In other words,
\begin{align}
    q_z(x,t,r) = \P^x \{Z_t = A\} .
\end{align}
(Recall that $Z$ depends implicitly on $r$.)
The description above implies that $q_z$ solves the following Kolmogorov backward equation:
\begin{align}
    \begin{aligned}  \label{eqn:q_pde}
    \dot q_A(x,t,r) 
            &= \sigma^2 \grad \log(p(x,t)) \cdot \grad q_A(x,t,r) 
                + \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \Delta q_A(x,t,r) 
            \\ &\qquad {} + 
                r (1-p(x,t))(q_B(x,t,r)-q_A(x,t,r))  \\
    \dot q_B(x,t,r) &= \sigma^2 \grad \log(1-p(x,t)) \cdot \grad q_B(x,t,r) 
            + \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \Delta q_B(x,t,r)
            \\ &\qquad {} + 
            r p(x,t) (q_A(x,t,r)-q_B(x,t,r))  ,
    \end{aligned} 
\end{align}
with boundary conditions $q_A(x,0,r)=1$ and $q_B(x,0,r)=0$, 
and where $\grad$ is the gradient, and $\Delta$ is the Laplacian.
%\alisa{this is fwd-in-time notation. should we change it to bwd-in-time?}
%\plr{This equation should be forwards in time, since it's the Kolmogorov backward equation
%applied to a backwards-time process!}

We will have more use for the differential operators on the right-hand sides of these equations,
so define these as
$G^A = \sigma^2 \grad \log(p(x,t)) \cdot \grad + (\sigma^2/2) \Delta$
and
$G^B = \sigma^2 \grad \log(1-p(x,t)) \cdot \grad + (\sigma^2/2) \Delta$,
and then equation \eqref{eqn:q_pde} can be written more compactly as
\begin{align*}
    \dot q_A &= G^A q_A + r (1-p) (q_A-q_B) \\
    \dot q_B &= G^B q_B + r (1-p) (q_B-q_A) .
\end{align*}
In technical terms, $G^A$ and $G^B$ are the generators of the diffusions of $A$ and $B$ lineages, respectively.


\paragraph{Numerical computation}
To determine how the cline at a linked locus is expected to relax,
we can solve the partial differential equations \eqref{eqn:cline_pde} and \eqref{eqn:q_pde} numerically.
For instance, Figure \ref{fig:linked_cline_heatmaps} shows a heatmap of $p(x,t,r)$, 
the expected frequency of ancestry $A$ at location $x$ and time $t$ 
at a site at recombination distance $r$ from the selected site,
which is computed as $p(x,t,r) = p(x,t) q_A(x,t,r) + (1-p(x,t)) q_B(x,t,r)$. 
The equations are solved numerically in R, using the ReacTran package \citep{soetaert2012reactive}.

\paragraph{Haplotype lengths}
We can also find the probability of seeing an \emph{entire} block of genome (haplotype)
of a single ancestry at a given location and time.
To quantify haplotype abundances, we start by considering a segment of the genome between positions $a$ and $b$, relative to the selected site. 
We are interested in the probability $g_z(x,t;a,b)$ 
of finding an entire segment $(a,b)$ of ancestry $A$ in an individual having selected allele of type $z$,
sampled at spatial location $x$ at time $t$ after the cline has formed.

As in \citet{Sedghifar2015}, 
a given block of genome is inherited along a single lineage ever since the most recent recombination event
that fell within that block.
Prior to this, there are two lineages to follow (see Figure~\ref{Fig:schematic}),
and so lineages act like a particular class of labeled, branching diffusions,
where the total branching rate is conserved. 
We do not consider subsequent coalescence.
The general description of the process, again looking backwards in time, is as follows:
The lineage of a segment of genome moves as a linked locus described in equations \eqref{eqn:lineage_motion},
with recombination distance $r$ equal to the rate at which the segment recombines away from the selected site.
(If the selected site lies inside the segment, $r=0$.)
Additionally, at rate equal to the genetic length of the segment,
a recombination occurs, at which point the segment splits into two segments at a uniformly chosen location,
each of which proceeds as before, independently. 
Then, $g_z(x,T;a,b)$ is then the probability that all branches are found on the $A$ side of the hybrid zone
at the time of secondary contact $T$ units of time ago.

The resulting equation si similar to \eqref{eqn:q_pde} with a term added for branching,
which is written (omitting the $(x,t)$ for conciseness):
\begin{align}
    \begin{aligned} \label{eqn:g_pde}
        \dot g_A(a,b) 
        &= G^A g_A(a,b) + r(a,b) (1-p) (g_A(a,b)-g_B(a,b))
            \\ {} & \qquad 
            + (1-p) \left( \int_a^0 
                g_B(a,\theta) g_A(\theta,b)
                + \int_0^b g_A(a,\theta) g_B(\theta,b)
            d\theta \right)
            \\ {} & \qquad 
            + p \int_a^b {
                g_A(a,\theta) g_A(\theta,b) 
            } d\theta
            - (b-a) g_A(a,b)  
    \end{aligned} ,
\end{align}
where $\theta$ is the genomic position of a recombination event, 
the integral $\int_a^0$ is zero if $a>0$ and likewise $\int_0^b$ is zero if $b<0$;
and $r(a,b)$ is the distance from the segment to the selected site:
$r(a,b)=0$ if $ab<0$ and $r(a,b)=\min(|a|,|b|)$ otherwise.
The equation for $g_B(x,t;a,b)$ is identical after exchanging $A \leftrightarrow B$ and
$p \leftrightarrow (1-p)$.
The boundary conditions are $g_A(x,0;a,b)=1$ and $g_B(x,0;a,b)=0$.

\paragraph{Numerical solutions}
Notice that equations \eqref{eqn:g_pde}
are hierarchical in $[a,b]$:
the equation for haplotype identity probabilities on a segment $[a,b]$ depends only on those probabilities for segments contained in $[a,b]$.
This allows for efficient numerical solutions,
described in more detail in Appendix \ref{apx:haplotype_calcs}.


\paragraph{Correlations in ancestry}
To compute correlations in local ancestry
(i.e., ``ancestry disequilibrium'', as in \citet{Pool2015,Schumer2016}),
we need only follow lineages at two sites, instead of an entire region,
the model described above requires only minor modifications,
and our numerical code can be used directly;
for more detail see Appendix~\ref{apx:haplotype_calcs}.

\subsection*{Simulations}

We implemented forwards-time simulations of diploid individuals on a one-dimensional grid of demes
with non-overlapping generations and fixed population sizes (a Wright-Fisher model). Individuals are diploid, with haploid number $n=2$ chromosomes, each of length 1 Morgan. One chromosome pair harbors in its center (at position 0.5M) a single locus that reduces fitness by $s$ in heterozygotes, while the other contains no sites under direct selection.

Each deme has exactly $N_d$ diploid individuals at the start of each generation.
At the start of each generation, every individual migrates to a new deme  offset by $\lfloor Z + 1/2 \rfloor$ from their original position,
where $Z$ is a Gaussian random variable with mean zero and variance $\sigma^2$.
(The mean displacement is zero, and when comparing to theory we compute $\sigma$ as the standard deviation of this distribution.)
Migrants past either end of the range remain at the terminal demes.
Then, 
fitnesses are computed (heterozygotes at the selected locus have fitness $1-s$; homozygotes have fitness 1),
and in each deme $N_d$ pairs of parents are chosen, with replacement,
with probability proportional to their fitness and selfing allowed.
Since migration is not conservative, demes may have no available parents;
in this case, parents are chosen from other demes with probability proportional to fitness
multiplied by $\exp(-x^2/\sigma^2)$, where $x$ is the distance to the other deme.
The next generation is formed by carrying out meiosis in each parent
and combining the resulting gametes such that each pair of parents leaves one descendant.
Meiosis results in alternating blocks of the gamete's chromsome
being inherited from the two parental chromosomes,
with the blocks separated by a Poisson(1) number of uniformly chosen recombination points along the chromosome,
and the order of the parental chromosomes chosen randomly.
The simulation software works by recording for each chromosome
a list of ancestry breakpoints and the index of the ancestor in the first generation
that the chromosome inherited that region of genome from;
genotyping at individual loci was performed by looking up the ancestor's genotype.

Hybrid zones of varying ages were simulated under conditions of $\sigma=1$ and $s=0.1$ and $s=0.01$. From this we measure the length of unbroken tracts of ancestry $B$ surrounding a given position along a chromosome (if the locus in question was of ancestry $A$ the ancestry block had length $0$). These were compared to the output of neutral simulations with $s=0$.

The simulations were executed in R, with scripts available on
\url{https://github.com/petrelharp/clinal-lineages}

\subsection*{Measures of introgression}


The above theory and simulations allow us to make predictions about patterns surrounding selected loci. In reality, however, such loci are not known, so it is useful to have per-site statistics that may allow for detection of candidate targets of selection. The most straightforward measure is $l_I(m)$,  the mean length of all haplotype chunks that contain genomic position $m$, given that $m$ is of ancestry $I$, where $I\in\{A,B\}$.
We then focus on $I_B(m)$ for $m$ across a chromosome. 
%Another statistic is the cumulative probability $C_I(m)$ of a sampled chunk encompassing position $m$ being longer than a chunk sampled from the distribution of all chunk lengths across the genome in the population. 

Additionally, we look at the mean value of these statistics in the two chunks, $m-$ and $m+$ that flank, to the left and right respectively, the block of unbroken ancestry containing $m$. Since there appears to be a signal at these regions also, we further define a statistic 
\begin{align*}
C(m) =  \frac{2\sum_i{l_B(m_i)}}{\sum_i{l_A(m_i+)+l_A(m_i-)}}
\end{align*}
where $m_i$ is the block length in individual $i$, and $C$ is  the mean block length around $m$ in the population, divided by the mean lengths of  the two blocks directly flanking the block containing $m$. 

We are interested in identifying regions of the genome with abnormal distributions of block lengths, and within each deme compute $l_B(m)$ and $C(m)$ across the genome. Where indicated, we normalize $l_B(m)$ and $C(m)$ by dividing by the empirical mean of $I_B$ and $C$ across the genome for a given deme. 
While there is useful information contained in the geographic distribution of block length patterns, obtaining good spatial sampling can often be difficult, and this allows us to search for  patterns if block lengths within relatively few populations. 
%\plr{I'm not sure what you mean by "predict patterns".}

Although our analytical model does not account for coalescence, we are able to partially trace the genealogy of haplotypes in our simulations. In particular, we wish to know the relative number of ancestors from $T$ generations ago that are represented in present day populations at a given locus, given the frequency of a particular ancestry. This is a reflection of the average size of a haplotype family, and is potentially a source of additional information. Within each deme $x$, we calculated $F_B(m,x)$, which is the number of independent ancestors from time $T$ contributing to the pool of alleles of ancestry $B$ at site $m$, divided by the number of individuals of ancestry $B$ at site $m$.
%\plr{how about $x$ instead of $X$? above $x$ refers to spatial location.}


%\subsection*{Data}
%We compare the predictions of our model to genomic data obtained from individuals sampled a naturally occurring hybrid zone between \emph{Mus m. musculus/M. m. domesticus} \cite{Turner2011,Turner2014}. The genomic data generated by \citep{Turner2014} was for a mapping population generated by mating wild-caught individuals. Because some individuals were mated multiple times, the mapping population comprises many closely related individuals. We approximate wild population samples by restricting our analysis to genotyped individuals that had both parents sampled in the same location in such a way that none of the individuals shared a parent (see table for list of individuals). Approximately 280,000 SNPs were represented in the final dataset. 

%Ancestry blocks were estimated using ChromopainterV2 \cite{Lawson2012} and STRUCTUREv2 \cite{Falush2003} with $k=2$.


%Although we expect the age of this hybrid zone to correspond to historical human movement, and therefore be thousands of years old \cite{Teschke2008}, weighted the physical scale of ancestry-disequilibrium (both in the form of weighted ancestry-LD \citep{Loh2013} and ancestral block lengths) suggest relatively recent hybridization. Specifically, the high LD between quite distantly linked SNPs in the FS population suggests that a relatively high proportion of early-generation hybrids, whereas the rapid decay of LD in the the TU population reflects a much older hybridization event.

\section*{Results}

\subsection*{Comparison of theory and simulation}

The theoretical results described above matched well with our individual-based simulations,
across a large range of parameter values.
This can be seen by comparing
clines in frequency of $A$ ancestry at linked loci,
either unconditional on the identity of the linked selected allele (Figure \ref{sfig:alleleFreq_tau100_comparison}),
or conditional on its identity 
(Figures \ref{sfig:condAlleleFreq_tau80_comparison}, \ref{sfig:condAlleleFreq_tau320_comparison}, and \ref{sfig:condAlleleFreq_tau1280_comparison}).


\subsection*{Single-locus behavior}

From previous results, we expect that far away from the zone center, variants under negative selection will be rare \citep[for demonstration of this theoretical result, see e.g.][]{May1975,Slatkin1973,Barton??}, and correspondingly, clines at closely linked sites are narrower.
This is seen, for instance, in Figures~\ref{alleleFreq_tau100},~\ref{alleel_Freq_tau100_weaker_s} and ~\ref{alleleFreq_tau1000}. 

\plr{When discussing haplotype lengths, say what happens at different $s$ and $T$.}

\paragraph{The timescale over which linked clines relax:}
Although loci not under selection can in principle spread across the cline unimpeded,
in practice it can take quite some time for even unlinked neutral loci to homogenize,
due to the decreased fitness of heterozygotes \citep{Barton1986}
and the relative slowness of diffusive movement \citep{Sedghifar2015}.
We are interested, for samples across a cline $T$ units of time after secondary contact, how far away from the selected locus one has to look to see clines that resemble the genome-wide mean.


A linked cline will begin to flatten out if there is an appreciable chance that a lineage at the linked locus initially coupled with an $A$ allele 
at some point recombined from an individual carrying the $B$ allele.
This implies that loci closer than $1/T$ to the selected site will not have a substantially wider cline than the selected cline.

In principle, the genomic window about the selected site
in which clines remain narrow could be quite a bit wider,
since the only way to move linked lineages between selected backgrounds is via recombination in a heterozygote,
and heterozygotes for the selected allele are only found at high frequency in the cline.
The majority of lineages are generally pushed away from the cline but have no bias far away,
so the amount of time a lineage spends in heterozygotes should grow as $\sqrt{T}$ for large $T$,
and so the width of the genomic region showing clines about the selected locus could be 
substantially larger than $1/T$. However, this distinction appears hard to observe for realistic parameter values.

%%%%% %%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{The distribution of ancestry tract lengths}

The distribution of contiguous ancestry block lengths necessarily contains more information than allele frequency alone. We are interested specifically in the how tracts of ancestry surrounding the selected locus compares to the rest of the genome. 
The raw data -- ancestry assignments for a few individuals sampled from across space --
is shown in Figure~\ref{Fig:resistanceToIntrogression1000g},
showing distinct patterns across geography and the genome.

As expected, regions surrounding a locus under selection are more resistant to introgression,
as seen in figures~\ref{Fig:resistanceToIntrogression1000g} and \ref{Fig:resistanceToIntrogression100g}).
When present, however, we expect haplotypes including the locally less common allele
to be longer than the genome-wide average.
Indeed,
as shown in Figures \ref{Fig:blockLengths}, \ref{Fig:blockLengthsZoom} and \ref{Supp:blockLengthHeatmap},
the mean length of such haplotype blocks are up to three times longer
than the average for that geographic location.


% This pattern provides a potential avenue for identifying targets of selection by looking for a signal of increased $l_B$ or $l_A$ for positions surrounding a selected site, compared to the genome-wide background  at geographic sites far from the center of the zone (Figure~\ref{Fig:blockLengths},~\ref{Supp:blockLengthHeatmap}). 
The mean haplotype length found without conditioning on ancestry ($l_\cdot$)
also shows an small increase near the selected locus,
but it is much smaller (see Figures \ref{Supp:blockLengthHeatmapNoAnc} and \ref{Supp:blockLengthNoAnc}).

\alisa{For very strong $s$, very few haplotypes are found on the ``wrong" side, and so the signal of longer haplotypes around selected loci may only be present at geographic locations close to the center of the zone. The overall length of the haplotypes decreases as the hybrid zone ages, but the signal remains strong relative to the rest of the genome and detectability will largely depend on the density of ancestry-informative markers.}

\alisa{how small is too small for s? when do we start seeing that peak (1/tau)? Bring paragraph here. Look at smaller spatial scale for the small s simulations}

Additionally, we find that $l_A(m\pm)$, the length of blocks adjacent to blocks containing $m$, are shorter than average when $m$ is in a block of unbroken ancestry surrounding a selected site on the ``wrong side'' of the side of the zone.  (Figure~\ref{Supp:adjacentBlocks}). This pattern provides an avenue for further enhancement of the block-length signal around a selected locus, by measuring $C(m)$  (Figures~\ref{Supp:ratioBlockAdjacent},~\ref{Supp:ratioBlockAdjacentHeatmap}).


We expect that, in the absence of selection, blocks of $A$ ancestry across the genome 
will tend to be shorter the further one goes into the $B$ side of the cline,
because they have had more opportunities to recombine with $B$ haplotypes. 
However, we expect that stretches of $A$ ancestry containing a selected site will be longer
than those that do not contain the selected site at the same spatial location,
because lineages containing the selected site have usually been inherited from the $A$ side of the cline recently. 
As discussed above, we expect these lineages move at speed roughly $\sigma/\sqrt{s}$,
so (selected) $A$ alleles at distance $x$ from the cline center
to have last had an ancestor on the $A$ side of the cline around $x \sqrt{s}/\sigma$ generations ago 
(compared to $x^2/\sigma^2$ for a neutral allele),
and so the enclosing $A$ haplotype is no longer than $\sigma/(x \sqrt{s})$.
%\plr{(check predicted decay of mean length $1/x$ in simulations?)}
For linked haplotypes not containing the selected site, the situation is more complicated, and harder to intuit.

%This pattern means that we can further refine the signal of block lengths around a selected locus, by measuring the ratio $\frac{2\sum{l_B(m_i)}}{\sum{l_A(m_i+)+l_A(m_i-)}}$ of mean block lengths surrounding a site with the mean length of adjacent blocks (Figures~\ref{Supp:ratioBlockAdjacent},~\ref{Supp:ratioBlockAdjacentHeatmap})



%We are interested specifically in the distribution of the length of continuous tracts of ancestry surrounding the selected locus. Far away from the zone center variants under negative selection will be rare \citep[for demonstration of this theoretical result, see e.g.][]{May1975,Slatkin1973,Barton??}, however, when present an unfit migrant haplotype is expected to be longer than a neutral migrant haplotype. Figure X shows the estimated probability density (pdf), of unbroken tract of ancestry B surrounding the selected locus, conditioning on a haplotype being of ancestry B at the selected locus. Compared to the expected density of tract lengths surrounding neutral loci, tracts of ancestry B around the selected locus are longer.

%Of particular interest is whether or targets of selection could potentially be identified by a signal of larger ancestry tracts surrounding them compared to a genome-wide background. To demonstrate this, we simulated a chromosome of length 1M with a selected site at position 0.5M. For a set of positions $\mathbf{m}$ along the chromosome, we computed the length $l_B(m_i)$ of the surrounding unbroken block of ancestry. There is a detectable signal of increased block length surrounding selected loci when conditioning on the less-fit ancestry (Figure~\ref{Fig:blockLengths},~\ref{Supp:blockLengthHeatmap}) at geographic sites far from the center of the zone. A signal is also present for, but less well resolved when ancestry is not taken into account (Figures~\ref{Supp:blockLengthHeatmapNoAnc},~\ref{Supp:blockLengthNoAnc}).

\subsection*{The number of `unfit' ancestors}

\plr{This needs a bit more precise discussion.}
\alisa{add motivation-- additional information in haplotype diversity. Present alternate hypotheses. This ties in with our world view within our model}
As expected, we find that the average family size of a $B$ allele decreases with distance into the $A$ side of the hybrid zone. 
% $F_B(m,x)$ is highest on the size of the hybrid zone where individuals of ancestry $B$ predominate. 
We find that at the selected locus, $F_B(m,x)$ decreases with x, and is lowest far away from the zone center, where ancestry $B$ is at low frequency  (Figure~\ref{Fig:family_size}). As $m$ moves further away from the target of selection, the average family size recovers to expected values under neutrality.

One interpretation of this observation is that migrants tend to leave few offspring before being removed from the population by selection, leaving behind small families. In conjunction with block length, measuring $F$ can provide an additional signal for characterizing lineages strongly influenced by selection, by looking at levels of haplotype diversity in populations along a hybrid zone.

%}

\alisa{Using a combination of theory and simulations, we present a description of the process of cline formation and haplotype structure in a relatively young (i.e. non-equilibrium) hybrid zone.
We show that clines establish over time $1/s$, and that lineages of selected loci tend to move back towards their `ancestral home' when in a geographic region where they  are unfit. 
This occurs at speed $\sigma/\sqrt{s}$. Based on this we predict, and observe in simulations, that blocks of ancestry surrounding these selected loci are longer, especially when distant from the center of the cline. 
This extends previous theoretical work on hybrid zones, which has primarily focused on stable clines in allele frequency and  suggests approaches to interpreting patterns of variation in hybrid zone populations, as well as detecting targets of purifying selection in hybrid zones.}

\subsection*{Genomic signals associated with targets of selection}

There is great interest in identifying the loci that are experiencing selection in hybrid zones. Popular approaches to this involve identifying alleles that are exceptional in terms of frequency across space, or genome-wide admixture proportion \citep{Porter1997,Gompert2012}.  
Current genomic resources, however, can provide an additional rich information when applied to the study of hybrid zones.
In particular, ancestry deconvolution facilitated by programs such as  hapMIX \citep{Price2009}, LAMP \citep{Sankararaman2008} and fineSTRUCTURE \citep{Lawson2012} provides researchers with a measure of the length of ancestry tracts across the genome and this information has been used extensively to infer the demographic history of hybridization/admixture from present day samples \citep[e.g. ][]{Hellenthal2014}. 
In order to interpret these patterns in the context of a hybrid zone, we set out to understand the impact of selection on patterns of ancestry tract lengths, and here present an expectation of block-length patterns throughout a hybrid zone. 
Importantly, we find that selection against hybrid incompatibilities leaves a distinct genomic signature in the form of long contiguous blocks of ancestry around these loci.
This pattern reflects the intuition that regions surrounding selected loci introgress less readily, and loci under selection can therefore be thought as moving under Brownian motion with drift whereby a lineage that is presently on the `` wrong" side of a hybrid zone rapidly moves, backwards in time, across space to the ``correct" side. 
In other words, disadvantageous alleles that have encroached deep into the other side of the hybrid zone have done so by chance and, since they do not persist for long on the ``wrong" side, are likely to have done so relatively recently. Haplotypes surrounding the selected locus therefore have had relatively few opportunities for recombination with different ancestries and this is reflected in longer blocks of contiguous ancestry.

Through our simulations we find also that blocks of ancestry that are have crossed the hybrid zone and are closely linked to the selected site without overlapping it (i.e., blocks that are adjacent to the block containing the selected site) are exceptionally short. This is measured by the mean length of the blocks adjacent to the block containing the selected site. A simple and intuitive explanation for this pattern is that loci physically linked to a selected site have recently come from the center of the zone or beyond. Compared to other chromosomes in their new geographic location, these migrants will have on average longer $B$ haplotypes at the selected locus, and shorter $A$ haplotypes nearby. 
This finding suggests that, despite the fact that  haplotypes surrounding incompatibilities might be quite long, genome scans may have the power to extract fine-grained regions near selected loci from the large chunks of ancestry that will often flank these regions. 


Our results suggest that a few natural statistical summaries could help identify selected loci in hybrid zones. 
Specifically, the statistic $l_z(k)$ -- the genetic length of ancestry surrounding a site of a given lineage -- and similarly,  and similarly $C(k)$, could provide a simple and informative summary. 
This statistic, perhaps in relation to the length of ancestry around adjacent sites, could be developed into an approach to scan genomes from hybrid zones to identify putatively selected loci. 

While these statistics presented here are currently detectable only in the few systems for which dense genetic markers and phase information is known, as the cost of sequencing continues to drop and long-phased reads become more common, the patterns described here could further aid in the identification of selected sites in hybrid zones. In the meantime, patterns of elevated pairwise LD, which is more easily computed from readily available low-density and unphased genomic data, could offer a less-powerful alternative to these findings. 


\plr{note that when drift starts to kick in for clines (around $\tau=320$) we start to get better power with haplotype lengths}

%However, how selection influences the length of tracts of ancestry around selected sites in hybrid zones has received much less attention. We we present an expectation of ancestry block lengths in hybrid zone. We find that selection against hybrid incompatibilities leaves a distinct genomic signature in the form of long contiguous blocks of ancestry around these loci.

We further find that the long blocks of ancestry around selected sites on the wrong side of the hybrid zone will be descended from a relatively large number of independent ancestors, per individual, of the less fit ancestry. This result reflects that, on average, less fit haplotypes tend to be recent migrants with few descendants.  



\subsection*{Assumptions}

We made numerous simplifying assumptions to derive our analytical and also in the execution of the simulations with respect to the architecture of selection, the geographic distribution of populations, and relatedness of individuals.

\paragraph{The nature of selection}
Although our assumed scenario of selection against heterozygotes at a single locus is uncommon in nature, we believe that this is unlikely to drastically influence our findings, as previous studies have demonstrated that underdominant loci share similar properties with more realistic models (e.g., ecological selection \citep{Barton1989,Barton1993}). 
We expect, therefore, our findings here to be somewhat generalizable. 

Our assumption of a single selected locus may have greater consequences. While our model is likely to be relevant to cases in which there are only a small number of targets of selection scattered throughout the genome, our predictions may differ significantly from situations in which the density of selected sites is higher. 
Having numerous selected sites within one ancestry block increases the strength of selection, and the relatively short map distances between linked incompatibilities generates a longer unit which is not readily broken up by recombination. Both factors are expected to result in regions that are surrounded by even greater chunks of unbroken ancestry, and will impact expectations of genome-wide pattens of clines and block lengths, as well as the resolution to which one could detect targets of selection. 
 $s$ and relatively short map distances between linked incompatibilities)
 

\paragraph{Geographic space and other sources of stochasticity}
For ease of calculations, our analytic model assumes a continuous and smooth one-dimensional spatial structure of the geographic landscape, allowing us to derive analytic expressions that track lineages. 
This assumes a large population density limit that excludes coalescence and makes lineages Markov.  
In contrast, our simulations model regularly spaced demes. 
In reality, populations may be patchily connected, especially at the edges of species ranges where hybrid zones may occur. 
While we still believe that the genomic signature of long ancestry chunks around selected sites will still hold in these situations, the strength of this expectation is unclear. 

Of particular concern that stems from the above assumption is that our model ignores potential, and likely, sources of stochasticity arising from geographic structure and coalescence/pedigree structure. The latter can result in an underestimate of covariance in ancestry, as we have ignored additional sharing of ancestry through shared genealogy \cite{Liang2014}. With respect to genealogy, the broad agreement between our analytic predictions and simulations (which include an explicit pedigree structure), suggests that this assumption does not have a severe qualitative impact on our major results when populations are moderately high, especially for all but the most recently formed hybrid zones. 

Lastly, while our theory focusses on a spatially arranged hybrid zone, it is likely that our results extend to alternative models of hybridization including models of assortative mating and hybrid swarms. This is because regardless of the specific demographic model, selection against hybrids will severely limit opportunities for recombination between ancestries around incompatibilities.




\subsection*{Theory and simulation}
In this work, we have taken two complementary approaches,
using both simulation and theory, and comparing the two.
As usual, simulations make fewer biological simplifications,
while theory provides more generalizable conclusions.
To do this, we have described the branching diffusion process that approximates
the lineages along which haplotypes are inherited.
Since the expected motion of a lineage depends on the local frequencies of the selected alleles,
these diffusions are time-inhomogeneous.

The diffusion model for lineages predicts that quantities of interest solve sets of coupled partial differential equations (PDE),
which we have written down.
As there are no known analytical solutions to these PDE,
we have constructed numerical solutions (and provide the source code for doing this).
A main role of these solutions in our work has been to verify that theory based on the diffusion model of lineages
matches the simulations.
These solutions easily and quickly provide predictions of joint frequencies at small numbers of loci:
about 1 second to compute predicted clines, as opposed to hours for the full simulation.
However, due to the high dimensionality of the haplotype problem (spatial position $\times$ time $\times$ endpoints of the haplotype),
numerical solutions for mean haplotype lengths along the genome can be as computationally intensive as simulations
(although are substantially less noisy).
More work could be done to develop more efficient methods of solution,
but it may be better to perform more biologically realistic forwards-time simulations that includes coalescence and drift.
Nonetheless, the PDE approach is easily modified to provide predictions for spatial and temporally inhomogeneous systems --
for instance, across maps of real landscapes.

%In contrast, our simulations model regularly spaced demes. In reality, populations may be patchily connected, especially at the edges of species ranges where hybrid zones may occur. While we still believe that the genomic signature of long ancestry chunks around selected sites will still hold in these situations, the strength of this expectation is unclear.

%Lastly, the analytic model presented here lacks \yb{both coalescence and a true pedigree structure}. \alisa{This can result in an underestimate of covariance in ancestry, as we have ignored sharing through genealogy \cite{Liang2014}.} 
%The broad agreement between our analytic predictions and simulations that include an explicit pedigree structure suggests that this assumption does not have a severe qualitative impact on our major results, especially for all but the most recently formed hybrid zones.

%Foremost, we have assumed that selection acts against heterozygotes, and that there is a single underdominant locus. This situation is uncommon in nature, since underdominant loci cannot invade when rare, and thus this assumption is likely rarely met. \alisa{We believe, however, that this assumption is unlikely to drastically influence our results, and previous results demonstrating that underdominant loci share similar properties as more realistic genetic models such as ecological selection, mean that our findings here are somewhat generalizable} \citep{Barton1989, Barton1993}



%\plr{(long blocks adjacent to short ones: combine with bit on long blocks)}
%In addition to our finding that ancestry surrounding selected sites is relatively long, our simulations revealed a consistent and unexpected finding. We found, on a given side of the hybrid zone, a transition from the locally adaptive ancestry at the selected site to the alternative ancestry at a closely linked site was short-lived (Figure~\ref{Supp:adjacentBlocks}). Put differently, blocks of `wrong' ancestry that do not overlap the selected site but are closely linked are exceptionally short. A simple intuitive explanation for this pattern suggests itself - loci physically linked to the selected sites can only survive on the wrong side of the hybrid zone for a reasonable amount of time if they recombine away from their ancestry at the locally adaptive site. Because it is then tightly linked to the alternate ancestry at the selected site, this ancestry chunk will largely recombine with the alternate ancestry, and therefore decay rapidly. \yb{This finding suggests that, despite the fact that haplotypes surrounding incompatibilities might be quite long, genome scans may have the power to extract fine-grained regions near selected loci from the large chunks of ancestry that will often flank these regions.}






%One major assumption of our model is that selection acts against heterozygotes --i.e. that loci are underdominant. 
%Under dominance is quite rare in nature, because underdominant loci cannot invade when rare, and thus our major assumption is likely rarely met. 
%We believe, however, that this assumption is unlikely to drastically influence our results --- previous research has found that under dominant loci  have similar proprrties in hybrid zones as more realistic genetic models, such as ecological selection \yb{(CITE: (BARTON and HEWITT 1989; BARTON and GALE 1993)}. 
%An additional assumption of our analytical model is that we ignore coalescence.  
%The broad agreement between our analytical and theoretical results suggests that this assumption will also have negligible effect on our results. 

%Also, parent-offspring dispersal is not the same thing as successful-offspring-parent dispersal.

\subsection*{Patterns of divergence}  
A number of studies have described heterogeneous patterns of genetic divergence across the genome. These so-called ``islands" of divergence \citep{Turner2005,Nosil2009} have been largely descriptive \citep{Cruickshank2014,Noor2009}, and as we begin to rigorously model patterns of divergence in the genome to begin to more  explore these patterns. The work presented here may offer ways in which to think about the process of heterogeneous divergence more concretely in terns of how processes such as migration and selection influence patterns across the genome of hybridizing populations. Specifically, we provide a natural interpretation of large contiguous chunks of ancestry, as sites linked to those experiencing selection.   
Overall, focusing on lengths of ancestry blocks across the genome brings focus to the processes of migration and selection rather than high-level summaries that are somewhat abstracted from the evolutionary process.

%\subsection*{Future directions}

%\plr{Perhaps delete this paragraph? A small note saying should check power with simulations up where we discuss the statistic would do.}
%Our work has highlighted distinct genomic signatures accompanying hybrid incompatibilities. 
%We suggest that such signatures could be combined in an inference framework that aims to identify incompatibilities from genome scans of hybrid zones.  
%However, doing so requires careful evaluation of potential signals of an incompatibility. 
%For example, should we consider jointly lengths of ancestry and allele frequencies to identify incompatibilities?
%Will dividing haplotype length by the length of adjacent haplotypes add power to tests because of the extra information contained in this measure, or add noise because of chance variation in these statistics.  
%Validation of the effectiveness of our proposed statistics, especially under demographic models that differ from the one dimensional hybrid zone explored above, will  provide a guide on how our results can be used to learn about selection from the distribution of ancestry tract lengths. We note, however, that power to detect regions under selection will depend on a number of parameters, such as $s$ and $T$

\plr{Remove "Future directions", title this "The hybrid filter", and discuss the hybrid filter ideas we had?}
\subsection*{Adaptive introgression}
\alisa{Could not find a reference to the hybrid filter}
\plr{don't have to call it the hybrid filter, and it looks like maybe I made up that term, but after reading this paper: \citet{martinsen2001hybrid}; these sorts of things are discussed in \citet{Barton1986}}

We have demonstrated here the potential utility for block length distributions in hybrid zone populations, particularly in populations that are found some distance from the center of the zone. While the focus here, has been on hybrid incompatibilities, the possibility that some loci adaptively introgress across hybrid zones has excited many biologists \citep{Arnold2004}. Future work could take a similar approach to understand how positive selection shapes ancestry block lengths, and predict  signatures of adaptive introgression in hybridizing populations using similar statistics presented here. These could eventually be combined to gain a fuller understanding of the forces shaping patterns of introgression in hybrid zones. 

%The best characterized example of adaptive introgression comes from the vitamin K epoxide reductase subcomponent 1 (vkorc1), which seems to have spread from Algerian mice \emph{Mus spretus} to house mice \emph{Mus musculus} from because it confers resistance to the anticoagulant rodenticide, warfarin. \citep{Song2011}. 
%Future work could dress expected genomic signatures of adaptive introgression in hybridizing populations using the number and length of haplotypes of non-native ancestry. 
%Doing so requires an understanding of how positive selection shapes ancestry block lengths in these cases.

\section{Rescaling a discrete model to obtain the lineage motion}
\label{apx:lineage_derivation}

For concreteness, here we describe a discrete model that rescales to the continuous model we consider.

In this discrete model, the total number of individuals at location $x$ is $N(x)$,
and we count ``individuals'' as \emph{haploid},
so each individual is of type either A or B at the selected locus,
and the proportion of individuals of type A and location $x$ and time $t$ is $p(x,t)$
(but, we often neglect the $t$).
Suppose that type A individuals at location $x$ reproduce at rate $s_A(x)$, 
and likewise type B at rate $s_B(x)$.
Assuming locally random mating, we will then have that
$s_A(x) = 1 - s (1-p(x))$ and $s_B(x) = 1 - s p(x)$.

At reproduction, individuals recombine with others in the same location,
with recombination occuring between the locus we follow and the selected locus with probability $r$,
and the offspring choose a new location $y$ with probability $m(x,y)$.
The population dynamics are random, 
but suppose that $N(x)$ is sufficiently large that these do not vary substantially with time.
Suppose this is a Moran model.
There are four things that can happen:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[$x\xrightarrow{AA}y$] One type A individual at location $x$ reproduces, 
        either does not recombine or recombines with another type A,
        and sends the offspring to $y$.
    \item[$x\xrightarrow{AB}y$] An individual at location $x$ reproduces, 
        recombines with the other type,
        and sends to $y$ an offspring
        who inherits at the selected locus from the type $B$ parent 
        and the at the neutral locus from the type A parent.
    \item[$x\xrightarrow{BA}y$] An individual at location $x$ reproduces, 
        recombines with the other type,
        and sends to $y$ an offspring
        who inherits at the selected locus from the type A parent 
        and the at the neutral locus from the type $B$ parent.
    \item[$x\xrightarrow{BB}y$] One type $B$ individual at location $x$ reproduces, 
        either does not recombine or recombines with another type $B$,
        and sends the offspring to $y$.
\end{enumerate}
These four things happen at rates:
\begin{align}
    & x\xrightarrow{AA}y & \qquad w_{AA}(x,y) &= p(x) s_A(x) \left(1 - r (1-p(x)) \right)  N(x) m(x,y) \\
    & x\xrightarrow{AB}y & \qquad w_{AB}(x,y) &= r p(x) (1-p(x)) \frac{s_A(x)+s_B(x)}{2} N(x) m(x,y) \\
    & x\xrightarrow{BA}y & \qquad w_{BA}(x,y) &= r p(x) (1-p(x)) \frac{s_A(x)+s_B(x)}{2} N(x) m(x,y) \\
    & x\xrightarrow{BB}y & \qquad w_{BB}(x,y) &= (1-p(x)) s_B(x) \left(1 - r p(x) \right) N(x) m(x,y) 
\end{align}

Note that at equilibrium, we require $N$ to solve
\begin{align}
  0 = \sum_y N(y) m(y,x) \left\{ p(y)s_A(y)(1-p(x)) - (1-p(y))s_B(y)p(x) \right\} .
\end{align}

\subsection*{Lineage movement}

These rates tell us the rates at which a lineage will move, backwards in time.
For instance, the rate at which a lineage at the selected locus
currently in a type A individual at location $x$
jumps to another type A individual at location $y$ is equal to the rate of influx of migrants from $y$
divided by the number of A alleles at $x$,
or
\begin{align}
  r_A(x,y) &= \frac{w_{AA}(y,x)}{p(x)N(x)} \\
  &= N(y) p(y) s_A(y) m(y,x) \frac{ 1 }{ N(x) p(x) } .
\end{align}

Let $X_t$ denote the position of the lineage of a selected locus of time $A$ at time $t$ in the past,
and let $f$ be test function with $f(\rho)=0$.
Then,
\begin{align}
    \deriv{t} \E[f(X_t) \given X_0=x ] &= \sum_y r_{A}(y,x) ( f(y)-f(x) ) \\
    &= \frac{1}{N(x)p(x)} \sum_y  N(y) p(y) s_A(y) m(y,x) ( f(y) - f(x)  ) . \label{eqn:discrete_generator}
\end{align}


\subsection*{Diffusion limit}
% from notes/lineage-movement.tex

Now suppose that $m(x,y)$ is symmetric, and depends on a parameter $\sigma$ so that as $\sigma \to 0$,
the associated random walk converges to Brownian motion, so that for an arbitrary smooth function $f$,
\begin{align}
    \lim_{\sigma \to 0} \sum_y \frac{ m(x,y) ( f(y) - f(x) ) }{\sigma^2} = \frac{1}{2} \dderiv{x} f(x) .
\end{align}
Write $f'(x) = \deriv{x}f(x)$, and note that
\begin{align}
    \frac{1}{\sigma^2} \sum_y g(y) m(y,x) (f(y)-f(x)) 
    &= \frac{1}{\sigma^2} \sum_y m(y,x) \left( g(y) f(y) - g(x) f(x) + (g(x)-g(y)) f(x) \right) \\
    &= \frac{1}{\sigma^2} \sum_y m(y,x) \left( g(y) f(y) - g(x) f(x) \right) \\
    & \qquad - f(x) \frac{1}{\sigma^2} \sum_y m(y,x) (g(y)-g(x)) \\
    &\xrightarrow{\sigma \to 0} \frac{1}{2} \dderiv{x}\left( g(x)f(x) \right) - \frac{1}{2} f(x) \dderiv{x} g(x) \\
    &= \frac{1}{2} \left( g(x) f'(x) + 2 g'(x) f'(x) + f(x) g''(x) - f(x) g''(x) \right) \\
    &= \frac{1}{2} g(x) f''(x) + g'(x) f'(x) . \label{eqn:deriv_limit}
\end{align}

Under these assumptions, combining \eqref{eqn:discrete_generator} and \eqref{eqn:deriv_limit},
\begin{align}
    \deriv{t} \E[f(X_{t/\sigma^2}) \given X_0=x ] &\xrightarrow{\sigma \to 0} 
    \frac{1}{2} s_A(x) \dderiv{x} f(x) 
    + \frac{1}{N(x)p(x)} \deriv{x} \left\{ N(x)p(x) s_A(x) \right\}  \deriv{x} f(x) \\
    &= \frac{1}{2} s_A(x) f''(x) + \left( s_A'(x) + \log(N(x)p(x))' s_A(x) \right) f'(x) ,
\end{align}
i.e.\ $X_{t/\sigma^2}$ converges to a diffusion with mean displacement
(``drift'' in diffusion terminology) $\frac{1}{ N(x)p(x)} \deriv{x} ( N(x) p(x) s_A(x) )$ and killed at rate $\rho k(x)$.

In our case, since $s_A(x) = 1 - s (1-p(x))$, the drift is $p'(x)/p(x)$ to first order in $s$;
the time scaling by $\sigma^2$ implies that the Brownian noise and the mean displacement
should both be scaled by $\sigma^2$.

\section{Numerical calculation of haplotype probabilities}
\label{apx:haplotype_calcs}.

In this section, we give details for how we found numerical solutions
to the partial differential equations (PDE) of the text,
which are all of reaction-diffusion type.
The R code, with worked examples, is available in our git repository.
Spatial grids were usually chosen to have at least four grid sites per dispersal distance,
but using substantially finer grids did not affect the results.

The forwards-time evolution of the selected alleles,
equation \eqref{eqn:cline_pde}, presents no difficulty;
we use the ReacTran package \citep{soetaert2012reactive} to compute discrete approximations to the diffusion term,
and the deSolve package \citep{soetaert2010solving} to solve the equation.

The equations \eqref{eqn:q_pde} describing probabilities that a lineage descends from $A$ ancestry,
conditional on the linked selected allele, required some more attention.
First, $s>0.1$ the system of equations can be \emph{stiff} 
(as is commonly observed for reaction-diffusion equations),
and hence slow to solve,
because of the extremely steep slope of the selected allele frequency $p(x,t)$.
In practice we used $s<0.1$.
Second, the ReacTran function tran.1D that converts the diffusion portion of the PDE into a system of ODE
contains a term like 
\begin{align*}
    \frac{1}{A(x)} \frac{d}{dx} A(x) f(x) = \frac{d}{dx} f(x) + f(x) \frac{d}{dx} \log A(x) ,
\end{align*}
where $A(x)$ is the interface area between grid cells, and $f(x)$ is the flux.
(See \citet{soetaert2012reactive} for more details.)
Discrete approximations of the left-hand side, as implemented in ReacTran, 
run into numerical difficulties if $A(x)$ is small,
and in our case, $A(x)$ is equal to $p$, the local frequency of the selected $A$ allele.
To avoid this, we made minor modifications to the tran.1D to provide a discrete approximation to the right-hand side.

Haplotype probabilities are obtained from equations \eqref{eqn:g_pde},
which is a coupled system of integro-differential equations in three variables plus time.
One method for solution would be via a Wild sum over the number of recombination events, 
as we did in \citet{Sedghifar2015}.
Here, we solved the equations numerically,
again discretizing the equations and using the ode.1D function of the deSolve package.
The reaction-diffusion part is the same as for equations \eqref{eqn:q_pde}.
The functions $g_A(x,t;a,b)$ and $g_B(x,t;a,b)$ are functions of space ($x$), time ($t$), 
and the endpoints of the block in question ($a$ and $b$, with $a<b$).
The second integral in \eqref{eqn:g_pde} is
\begin{align} \label{eqn:unifprod}
    \int_a^b { g_A(a,\theta) g_A(\theta,b) } d\theta .
\end{align}
Conceptually, this is an integral transformation
$g(a,b) \mapsto \int_a^b g(a,\theta) g(\theta,b) d\theta$;
the reason it appears here is that for the entire segment $(a,b)$ to be of ancestry $A$,
if there was a recombination at $\theta$,
the two segments $(a,\theta)$ and $(\theta,b)$ must both be of ancestry $A$
(and, ignoring coalescence, these probabilities are independent).
Suppose we have divided the segment of chromosome into a regular grid, say, $r_1 < \ldots < r_n$.
The natural discretization approximates this transformation by a sum,
and is equivalent to keeping track of only a finite number of loci.
Writing $g_A(i,j)$ for $g_A(x,t;r_i,r_j)$,
the discrete transformation we use corresponding to \eqref{eqn:unifprod}
is $g_A(i,j) \mapsto {}$ the sum
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{k=i}^{j-1} (r_{k+1}-r_k) g_A(i,k) g_A(k+1,j) .
\end{align*}
This is the correct term for the process only tracking loci on the grid, because
for all the alleles at $r_i, r_{i+1}, \ldots, r_j$ to be of ancestry $A$,
when a recombination occurrs between $r_k$ and $r_{k+1}$,
the sequences of alleles at $r_i, \ldots, r_{k}$ and at $r_{k+1}, \ldots, r_j$ must each be of ancestry $A$.
The first integral term in \eqref{eqn:g_pde} is
\begin{align} \label{eqn:biprod}
    \int_a^0 g_B(a,\theta) g_A(\theta,b) d\theta
    + \int_0^b g_A(a,\theta) g_B(\theta,b) d\theta 
\end{align}
We now require that one of the grid points along the chromosome is exactly at the selected site;
say this is $r_\ell = 0$.
The discrete term corresponding to \eqref{eqn:biprod} is
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{k=i}^{\ell-1} (r_{k+1}-r_k) g_B(i,k) g_A(k+1,j) +
    \sum_{k=\ell}^{j-1} (r_{k+1}-r_k) g_A(i,k) g_B(k+1,j) .
\end{align*}
Since these are not easily vectorizable in R, for efficiency
we implemented the discrete transformations in C, using the Rcpp package \citep{Eddelbuettel2011}.
In implementing these,
we kept track of $g_A(i,j)$ in a vector in the order that the upper triangular elements of a matrix are encountered
when traversing the matrix column-wise,
allowing for efficient computation of the sum.

\paragraph{A note on symmetry:}
The equations we present have the symmetry that they are invariant after exchanging $A$ and $B$ and reversing space.
For instance, $q_A(x,t,r) = 1 - q_B(-x,t,r)$.
Using this fact would speed up the code by a factor of two,
at the cost of generality:
as written, it would be easy to modify the code to allow space to be inhomogeneous 
(which would break this symmetry).
