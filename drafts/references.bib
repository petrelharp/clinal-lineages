@article{barton2000epistasis,
	Abstract = {Within hybrid zones that are maintained by a balance between selection and dispersal, linkage disequilibrium is generated by the mixing of divergent populations. This linkage disequilibrium causes selection on each locus to act on all other loci, thereby steepening clines, and generating a barrier to gene flow. Diffusion models predict simple relations between the strength of linkage disequilibrium and the dispersal rate, sigma, and between the barrier to gene flow, B, and the reduction in mean fitness, W. The aim of this paper is to test the accuracy of these predictions by comparison with an exact deterministic model of unlinked loci (r = 0.5). Disruptive selection acts on the proportion of alleles from the parental populations (p,q): W = exp[-S(4pq)beta], such that the least fit genotype has fitness e-s. Where beta << 1, fitness is reduced for a wide range of intermediate genotypes; where beta >> 1, fitness is only reduced for those genotypes close to p = 0.5. Even with strong epistasis, linkage disequilibria are close to sigma 2p'ip'j/rij, where p'i, p'j are the gradients in allele frequency at loci i, j. The barrier to gene flow, which is reflected in the steepening of neutral clines, is given by [formula: see text] where r, the harmonic mean recombination rate between the neural and selected loci, is here 0.5. This is a close approximation for weak selection, but underestimates B for strong selection. The barrier is stronger for small beta, because hybrid fitness is then reduced over a wider range of p. The widths of the selected clines are harder to predict: though simple approximations are accurate for beta = 1, they become inaccurate for extreme beta because, then, fitness changes sharply with p. Estimates of gene number, made from neutral clines on the assumption that selection acts against heterozygotes, are accurate for weak selection when beta = 1; however, for strong selection, gene number is overestimated. For beta > 1, gene number is systematically overestimated and, conversely, when beta < 1, it is underestimated.},

abstract = {Explicit formulae are given for the effects of a barrier to gene flow on random fluctuations in allele frequency; these formulae can also be seen as generating functions for the distribution of coalescence times. The formulae are derived using a continuous diffusion approximation, which is accurate over all but very small spatial scales. The continuous approximation is confirmed by comparison with the exact solution to the stepping stone model. In both one and two spatial dimensions, the variance of fluctuations in allele frequencies increases near the barrier; when the barrier is very strong, the variance doubles. However, the effect on fluctuations close to the barrier is much greater when the population is spread over two spatial dimensions than when it occupies a linear, one-dimensional habitat: barriers of strength comparable with the dispersal range (B approximately equal to sigma) can have an appreciable effect in two dimensions, whereas only barriers with strength comparable with the characteristic scale (B approximately equal to L=sigma/sqrt\{2mu\}) are significant in one dimension (mu is the rate of mutation or long-range dispersal). Thus, in a two-dimensional population, barriers to gene flow can be detected through their effect on the spatial pattern of genetic marker alleles.},

@article{kirkpatrick2006chromosome,
  abstract = {We study the evolution of inversions that capture locally adapted alleles when two populations are
exchanging migrants or hybridizing. By suppressing recombination between the loci, a new inversion can
spread. Neither drift nor coadaptation between the alleles (epistasis) is needed, so this local adaptation
mechanism may apply to a broader range of genetic and demographic situations than alternative hypotheses
that have been widely discussed. The mechanism can explain many features observed in
inversion systems. It will drive an inversion to high frequency if there is no countervailing force, which
could explain fixed differences observed between populations and species. An inversion can be stabilized
at an intermediate frequency if it also happens to capture one or more deleterious recessive mutations,
which could explain polymorphisms that are common in some species. This polymorphism can cycle in
frequency with the changing selective advantage of the locally favored alleles. The mechanism can
establish underdominant inversions that decrease heterokaryotype fitness by several percent if the cause
of fitness loss is structural, while if the cause is genic there is no limit to the strength of underdominance
that can result. The mechanism is expected to cause loci responsible for adaptive species-specific differences
to map to inversions, as seen in recent QTL studies. We discuss data that support the hypothesis,
review other mechanisms for inversion evolution, and suggest possible tests.},

  abstract = {Expected gene frequencies are described for a simple genetic system. The development emphasizes the effects of different fitness requirements among environmental pockets, associated groups of individuals (colonies), and migration. The effects of isolation and migration are reflected as translations of the x1 and x2 displacement distances. The net effect of finite colony size is to reduce the magnitude of change in expected gene frequency per generation as compared to that obtained by infinite theory. For two special cases, a clinal variation in fitness and a pocket of differential fitness, a detailed analysis is given, including results of computer analyses. In general, a clinal variation in fitness yields a narrow hybrid belt. Peripheral areas of differential fitness for a genotype (the region being primarily neutral with respect to relative fitness of genotypes) or differences in fitness considerably less than those considered can lead to an extended belt. Migration can mask a pocket of differential fitness. Some critical pocket sizes corresponding to selected differential fitnesses are given. Interpretations for selected biological systems are made.},

@article{barton2002continuous,
  abstract = {We introduce a general recursion for the probability of identity in state of two individuals sampled from a population subject to mutation, migration, and random drift in a two-dimensional continuum. The recursion allows for the interactions induced by density-dependent regulation of the population, which are inevitable in a continuous population. We give explicit series expansions for large neighbourhood size and for low mutation rates respectively and investigate the accuracy of the classical Malécot formula for these general models. When neighbourhood size is small, this formula does not give the identity even over large scales. However, for large neighbourhood size, it is an accurate approximation which summarises the local population structure in terms of three quantities: the effective dispersal rate, σe; the effective population density, ρe; and a local scale, κ, at which local interactions become significant. The results are illustrated by simulations.

@article{felsenstein1975pain,
  abstract = {Malecot's models of isolation by distance seem to assume random distribution in space, Poisson distribution of offspring number, and independent migration of individuals. These assumptions are inconsistent. By calculating the probability of joint occupancy of two locations at a distance x, it is shown that a haploid model embodying the latter two assumptions violates the first, forming larger and larger clumps of individuals separated by greater and greater distances. Thus the model is biologically irrelevant, even though it is possible to use it to calculate probabilities of genetic identity at different distances. The formation of these clumps is verified by computer simulation. The same phenomenon occurs in two- and three-dimensional models. In models of finite regions (a circle or a torus), the formation of clumps takes the form of the certainty of ultimate local extinction of the organism in each region. This does not occur if we hold the number of individuals on the circle or torus constant, but considerable departure from random distribution still results. The stepping-stone models appear for the present to be the only well-defined models of geographically structured populations with finite population density.},

@article{felsenstein1975genetic,
  abstract = {Genetic drift will cause a migration-selection cline to wobble about its expected position. A rough linear approximation is developed, valid when local populations are large. This is used to calculate effects of genetic drift on clines in a stepping-stone model with abrupt and with gradual changes of selection coefficients at a single haploid locus. Among the quantities calculated are measures of slope, standardized variation of gene frequencies around their expected values, and correlation among neighboring populations with respect to deviations from the expected gene frequencies. These quantities appear to be primarily functions of Ns and Nm for a given pattern of selection. Computer simulation gives rough confirmation of these results. Standardized variances of gene frequencies and correlation of neighbors differ along the cline in the case of smooth changes in selection. In no case is pathological behavior of gene frequency deviations found near the boundaries of selective regions. Local behavior of gene frequences of nearby colonies is approximately predicted by a simple adaptation of the stepping-stone theory of Kimura and Weiss. Approximate measures of the lateral variation of the midpoint of a cline and the probability of non-monotonicity are also calculated and discussed.},

@article{fisher1950frequencies,
  abstract = {IN 1937 (1) the author studied the distribution of the gene ratio in the
simple case of an advantageous gene advancing along a linear habitat
under a constant selective advantage. In Nature situations must be
more complex than in this simple model; in particular it must often occur
that the selective advantage itself varies with position. The interest-
ing case arises in which a gene enjoys a selective advantage in one part of
a species' range, while in the remainder it is at a selective disadvantage.
On the boundary between these regions selection is neutral between two
allelomorphic genes.
Cases can be observed in practice in which there is a gradient, or
line, in the frequencies of the genotypes determined by a single factor.
Generally such cases will be complicated by inequalities of topography,
and by consequent irregularities in the population density, and in the
gradient of selective advantage. It is to be expected also that the boun-
dary will in general neither be straight (i.e. a great circle of the earth's
surface), nor constant in position under the conditions prevailing in
different years. Any model worth discussing from a theoretical stand-
point will therefore be a drastically simplified one, playing the part of a
basis for comparisons by which the real complexities of each situation
may be critically demonstrated.
The purely genetical complication of non-recognition of genotype,
due to dominance, is also ignored. This is chiefly because I should regard
the occurrence of true dominance in such cases as a danger-signal sug-
gesting the very different genetic situation of a balanced polymorphism;
partly because if on more careful examination it is found that the hetero-
zygote is recognizable this will greatly increase the value of the observa-
tions.
The problem chosen for discussion, as an extension of my work of
1937, thus differs materially from that considered by Haldane in 1948

@article{martinsen2001hybrid,
  abstract = {Hybrids have long been recognized as a potential pathway for gene flow between species that can have important consequences for evolution and conservation biology. However, few studies have demonstrated that genes from one species can introgress or invade another species over a broad geographic area. Using 35 genetically mapped restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers of two species of cottonwoods (Populus fremontii x P. angustifolia) and their hybrids (n = 550 trees), we showed that the majority of the genome is prohibited from introgressing from one species into the other. However, this barrier was not absolute; Fremont cpDNA and mtDNA were found throughout the geographic range of narrowleaf cottonwood, and 20% of the nuclear markers of Fremont cottonwood introgressed varying distances (some over 100 km) into the recipient species' range. Rates of nuclear introgression were variable, but two nuclear markers introgressed as fast as the haploid, cytoplasmically inherited chloroplast and mitochondrial markers. Our genome-wide analysis provides evidence for positive, negative, and neutral effects of introgression. For example, we predict that DNA fragments that introgress through several generations of backcrossing will be small, because small fragments are less likely to contain deleterious genes. These results argue that recombination will be important, that introgression can be very selective, and that evolutionary forces within the hybrid population to effectively "filter" gene flow between species. A strong filter may make introgression adaptive, prevent genetic assimilation, lead to relaxed isolating mechanisms, and contribute to the stability of hybrid zones. Thus, rather than hybridization being a negative factor as is commonly argued, natural hybridization between native species may provide important genetic variation that impacts both ecological and evolutionary processes. Finally, we propose two hypotheses that contrast the likelihood of contemporary versus ancient introgression in this system.},

It is found that the equations describing this process are simple modifications of the equations describing the process assuming that the two loci are completely linked. Thus, the statistical properties of the genealogical process for a random sample at a neutral locus linked to a locus with selection follow from the results obtained for the selected locus. Sequence data from the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) region of Drosophila melanogaster are examined and compared to predictions based on the theory. It is found that the spatial distribution of nucleotide differences between Fast and Slow alleles of Adh is very similar to the spatial distribution predicted if balancing selection operates to maintain the allozyme variation at the Adh locus. The spatial distribution of nucleotide differences between different Slow alleles of Adh do not match the predictions of this simple model very well.},

@article{liang2014lengths,
abstract = {The distribution of admixture tract lengths has received considerable attention, in part because it can be used to infer the timing of past gene flow events between populations. It is commonly assumed that these lengths can be modeled as independently and identically distributed (iid) exponential random variables. This assumption is fundamental for many popular methods that analyze admixture using hidden Markov models. We compare the expected distribution of admixture tract lengths under a number of population-genetic models to the distribution predicted by the Wright-Fisher model with recombination. We show that under the latter model, the assumption of iid exponential tract lengths does not hold for recent or for ancient admixture events and that relying on this assumption can lead to false positives when inferring the number of admixture events. To further investigate the tract-length distribution, we develop a dyadic interval-based stochastic process for generating admixture tracts. This representation is useful for analyzing admixture tract-length distributions for populations with recent admixture, a scenario in which existing models perform poorly.},

	Annote = {North American populations of Drosophila melanogaster derive from both European and African source populations, but despite their importance for genetic research, patterns of ancestry along their genomes are largely undocumented. Here, I infer geographic ancestry along genomes of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) and the D. melanogaster reference genome, which may have implications for reference alignment, association mapping, and population genomic studies in Drosophila. Overall, the proportion of African ancestry was estimated to be 20{\%} for the DGRP and 9{\%} for the reference genome. Combining my estimate of admixture timing with historical records, I provide the first estimate of natural generation time for this species (approximately 15 generations per year). Ancestry levels were found to vary strikingly across the genome, with less African introgression on the X chromosome, in regions of high recombination, and at genes involved in specific processes (e.g., circadian rhythm). An important role for natural selection during the admixture process was further supported by evidence that many unlinked pairs of loci showed a deficiency of Africa--Europe allele combinations between them. Numerous epistatic fitness interactions may therefore exist between African and European genotypes, leading to ongoing selection against incompatible variants. By focusing on hubs in this network of fitness interactions, I identified a set of interacting loci that include genes with roles in sensation and neuropeptide/hormone reception. These findings suggest that admixed D. melanogaster samples could become an important study system for the genetics of early-stage isolation between populations.},

@article{sedghifar2015spatial,
abstract = {Recent genomic studies have highlighted the important role of admixture in shaping genome-wide patterns of diversity. Past admixture leaves a population genomic signature of linkage disequilibrium (LD), reflecting the mixing of parental chromosomes by segregation and recombination. These patterns of LD can be used to infer the timing of admixture, but the results of inference can depend strongly on the assumed demographic model. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework for modeling patterns of LD in a geographic contact zone where two differentiated populations have come into contact and are mixing by diffusive local migration. Assuming that this secondary contact is recent enough that genetic drift can be ignored, we derive expressions for the expected LD and admixture tract lengths across geographic space as a function of the age of the contact zone and the dispersal distance of individuals. We develop an approach to infer age of contact zones, using population genomic data from multiple spatially sampled populations by fitting our model to the decay of LD with recombination distance. To demonstrate an application of our model, we use our approach to explore the fit of a geographic contact zone model to three human genomic data sets from populations in Indonesia, Central Asia, and India and compare our results to inference under different demographic models. We obtain substantially different results from those of the commonly used model of panmictic admixture, highlighting the sensitivity of admixture timing results to the choice of demographic model.},

	Annote = {The African malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (A. gambiae), provides a unique opportunity to study the evolution of reproductive isolation because it is divided into two sympatric, partially isolated subtaxa known as M form and S form. With the annotated genome of this species now available, high-throughput techniques can be applied to locate and characterize the genomic regions contributing to reproductive isolation. In order to quantify patterns of differentiation within A. gambiae, we hybridized population samples of genomic DNA from each form to Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays. We found that three regions, together encompassing less than 2.8 Mb, are the only locations where the M and S forms are significantly differentiated. Two of these regions are adjacent to centromeres, on Chromosomes 2L and X, and contain 50 and 12 predicted genes, respectively. Sequenced loci in these regions contain fixed differences between forms and no shared polymorphisms, while no fixed differences were found at nearby control loci. The third region, on Chromosome 2R, contains only five predicted genes; fixed differences in this region were also verified by direct sequencing. These ``speciation islands''remain differentiated despite considerable gene flow, and are therefore expected to contain the genes responsible for reproductive isolation. Much effort has recently been applied to locating the genes and genetic changes responsible for reproductive isolation between species. Though much can be inferred about speciation by studying taxa that have diverged for millions of years, studying differentiation between taxa that are in the early stages of isolation will lead to a clearer view of the number and size of regions involved in the genetics of speciation. Despite appreciable levels of gene flow between the M and S forms of A. gambiae, we were able to isolate three small regions of differentiation where genes responsible for ecological and behavioral isolation are likely to be located. We expect reproductive isolation to be due to changes at a small number of loci, as these regions together contain only 67 predicted genes. Concentrating future mapping experiments on these regions should reveal the genes responsible for reproductive isolation between forms.},

@article{cox1995hybrid,
  abstract = {In this paper, the authors study the dynamics of hybrid zones in the absence of selection: They consider a process $(ŋ_t)_{t\geq 0}$ with state space ${(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)}^{\bold Z^d\times {1,2}}$, where $(ŋ_t(x,1),ŋ_t(x,2))$ is a pair of genes which represent the state of the individual at site $x\in\bold Z^d$ at time $t$. It evolves according to a translation-invariant, irreducible, symmetric probability transition $p(·,·)$ on $\bold Z^d$ with finite second moments, in the following way. At rate 1, each individual is replaced by a new one: it chooses each of its two parents with probability $p(·,·)$, then picks at random one of the parents' two genes (all these choices being independent); the two genes obtained are the individual's new state. This description corresponds to a voter model [see T. M. Liggett, Interacting particle systems, Springer, New York, 1985; MR0776231 (86e:60089)]. Taking for initial configuration $(0,0)$ on sites $x\in\bold Z^d$ with $x_1\geq 0$, and $(1,1)$ if $x_1<0$ ($x_1$ is the first coordinate of $x$), the authors look at the evolution of the interface between 0's and 1's, which gives rise to a hybrid zone.

They show that, in dimension $d>1$, the width of the hybrid zone grows as $\sqrt t$. In dimension 1, assuming that $p(·,·)$ has finite third moments, they prove that the interface process is an irreducible, positive recurrent Markov chain, with an equilibrium distribution of infinite mean (except in the nearest neighbor case where nothing moves). The first step of the proofs transforms a particle system's problem into a random walk problem, because the voter model is in duality with coalescing random walks. The key tools are therefore refined properties of random walks (in particular, about the recurrent potential kernel), and these theorems are interesting on their own.

Finally, the authors illustrate their belief that tight interfaces are common in one-dimensional particle systems: They explain conjectures for the contact process [see T. M. Liggett, op. cit.], for a model of oxidation of carbon monoxide on a catalyst surface (defined by R. M. Ziff, E. Gulari and Y. Barshad [Phy. Rev. Lett. 56 (1986), no. 24, 2553--2556]), mention results on simple exclusion [see P. A. Ferrari, C. Kipnis and E. Saada, Ann.

@article{barton2010phylogeography,
  abstract = { Classical models of gene flow fail in three ways: they cannot explain large-scale patterns; they predict much more genetic diversity than is observed; and they assume that loosely linked genetic loci evolve independently. We propose a new model that deals with these problems. Extinction events kill some fraction of individuals in a region. These are replaced by offspring from a small number of parents, drawn from the preexisting population. This model of evolution forwards in time corresponds to a backwards model, in which ancestral lineages jump to a new location if they are hit by an event, and may coalesce with other lineages that are hit by the same event. We derive an expression for the identity in allelic state, and show that, over scales much larger than the largest event, this converges to the classical value derived by Wright and Malécot. However, rare events that cover large areas cause low genetic diversity, large-scale patterns, and correlations in ancestry between unlinked loci.
