To the editors --

We would like to submit this manuscript for consideration in the special issue on the Genomics of Hybridization.  The paper makes several contributions to the understanding of hybrid zones, namely (1) it takes a lineage-based approach to the problem, which lends itself to intuitive understanding, as well as: (2) the initial process by which a hybrid zone is established (much of the previous work studies zones in quasi-equilibrium); and (3) we also study distributions of haplotype block lengths, which might be used to identify recently established zones and find incompatibilities segregating in the zone.  We think it will be of substantial interest to the readers of Molecular Ecology for these reasons, particularly because it provides new tools for researchers studying hybrid zones with modern genomic data (which allow haplotype calling).

Sincerely,
  Peter Ralph, Alisa Sedghifar, and Yaniv Brandvain.
