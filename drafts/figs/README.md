# Figures for the manuscript:

Here is the description of some scripts that produce figures in the manuscript (and/or ones similar to those).
These are often modifications of scripts in the [sims/](../../sims/) directory.

- `blockLengthPlotsS0.001.R` provides examples of how to turn these into plots and heatmaps as they appear in the manuscript (e.g. Figure 5)
	
- `Plot_frequency_clines.R` will plot ancestry frequency clines for multiple loci across the genome for both (Corresponds to Fig. 2 in the manuscript). 

- `number_of_ancestors.R` will plot the average family size of migrants. You will need to run `number_of_inds.R` first. 
    A lot of variables are hard-coded (sorry!), so these will need to be modified to suit your needs.
