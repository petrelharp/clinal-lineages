        \textbf{Probabilities of $A$ ancestry,}
        across space (vertical axis, in units of $\sigma$) 
        and time (horizontal axis, in generations).
        In each plot, color corresponds to the expected frequency of $A$ ancestry
        at a particular location in time and space.
        The selection coefficient is $s=.02$.
        \textbf{Top left:} at the selected site, showing establishment and stabilization of the cline
        on a time scale of $1/s=50$ generations.
        \textbf{Bottom left:} at an unliked site,
        with cline flattening continuing with $\sqrt{t}$.
        Remaining figures show frequencies of $A$ ancestry \emph{conditional}
        on the ancestry at the selected site,
        at different distances from the selected site ($r=.01$, .04, and 0.5 Morgans),
        as described in the text (see definition of $q_z(x,t,r)$).

        expected genotype counts were obtained assuming random mating,
