Cline by RI or environment?

Haplotype tree! Between two selected loci, or around a selected locus.

Adaptive introgression shifts cline center?

Joachim in space: how long until adaptive introgression can escape a bunch of linked deleterious stuff: calculate haplotype chunk length in the tail.  could happen in center, too, though?  Also: when are sweeps soft?

Non-stationary: properties in terms of time since cline formed?


SMBE

Scenario: Recent HZ can we detect selection, and distinguish it from neutral clines.
	- migrant alleles may be too rare to be informative
	- Deleterious migrant haploytpes should have long, rare haplotypes.
	
	- Perhaps have a cline under selection reach equilibrium really quickly, and then describe patterns conditioning on that cline.

Fun things:
	- Adaptive introgression, patterns of diversity.
	- Cov. in ancestry at a neutral linked site.
	- How much sharing should two blocks have?
	
Question:
	- Can we tell if a HZ is in fact a tension zone?
		- variance in cline width?
		- find number of selected alleles?

Ideas/patterns:
	- Variance in covariances for a fixed distance (not clear if this was meant to be genetic or geographic space)
	- Figure out s given genome-wide covariances?
	- Parametrize a moving cline
	- Covariance in ancestry between two geographically separate lineages
	- BM with drift dynamics to determine transitions probability of background ancestry
	
	- 


Potential datasets (not sure if data exists for all of these yet):
	- Mouse
	- Sparrow
	- Rabbit
	- Xiphophorus
	- Poplars
	- Yakuba-Santomea
	- Bombina
	- torts
